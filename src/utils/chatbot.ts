The cool part is the interactive UI - you can select objects via click-and-drag, and the system handles everything from template matching with Kalman filtering to full PID control. I'm obsessed with performance here - achieving sub-frame latency while maintaining robust safety mechanisms. It's cross-platform too (Windows, macOS, Linux).`,
        `Let me tell you about AeroForge - it's a framework I'm building for computer vision-based drone control. The tech stack is C++20, OpenCV, and ImGui for the HUD. The system can track objects in real-time with sub-frame latency, which is crucial for responsive drone control. I've implemented comprehensive safety features: geofence, e-stop, speed limits, hold-to-enable control. Plus, there's full test coverage with Catch2. Still actively working on it! You can check it out on GitHub: https://github.com/IdanG7/AeroForge`,

The architecture is fully microservices-based - separate services for Auth, Lobby, Session management, and Leaderboards. Everything communicates asynchronously via NATS message broker, with PostgreSQL for persistence and Redis for caching. I've also integrated full observability: Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger for tracing. It's Kubernetes-ready and demonstrates how to build truly scalable real-time systems.`,

The cool part is the performance - sub-100ms matching times even at scale (10K+ concurrent players). I designed it as modular microservices, so each component (Auth, Lobby, Session, Leaderboard) can scale independently. Used NATS for async messaging, and the whole thing is containerized with Docker and ready for Kubernetes deployment.`,
